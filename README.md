# Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models on Yelp Reviews

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that conducts a comparative study of various machine learning models applied to Yelp restaurant reviews. The study evaluates the performance of Naive Bayes as a baseline shallow learning model and BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa as deep learning models.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare the effectiveness of traditional machine learning techniques against modern deep learning approaches in processing and classifying Yelp restaurant reviews.

## Models Evaluated

- **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**: Used as the baseline model for shallow learning.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A deep learning model known for its high performance in natural language processing tasks.
- **DistilBERT**: A lighter version of BERT that retains most of its performance.
- **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT approach)**: An optimized version of BERT that has been fine-tuned to provide even better performance.
